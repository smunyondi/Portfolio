                    My name is Simeon Munyondi, a 26-year-old self-employed electronics technician based in Nyeri County, Kenya. For the past three years, I’ve been actively working in the electronics field, offering repair and maintenance services for various electronic devices. Alongside my technical work, I’ve always had a strong interest in computer programming, which led me to explore coding through YouTube tutorials and self-learning platforms. This curiosity and passion for technology motivated me to pursue a more structured path in software development.
                    <br>
                    In 2025, I enrolled in the PLP Academy, where I’m currently studying Software Engineering with a focus on Web Development. I am learning key programming languages and technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Database Querying. As part of my learning journey, I am now working on a personal portfolio project that will serve as my online CV, showcasing my skills, background, and the progress I’ve made as I transition from electronics to the world of software development.

                    <h2><u>Electronics Troubleshooting and Repair</u></h2>
                    <p>
                        As an electronics technician, I have over three years of hands-on experience in diagnosing, repairing, and maintaining a wide range of electronic devices and systems. My work primarily involves troubleshooting faults in consumer electronics such as televisions, radios, amplifiers, power supply units, and home appliances. I possess a strong understanding of electronic components and circuitry, which allows me to carry out accurate fault-finding using tools like multimeters, oscilloscopes, soldering equipment, and signal testers.
                        <br>
                        I take pride in delivering reliable and cost-effective repair solutions to clients, ensuring that their devices are restored to full functionality. Over time, I’ve also gained experience in assembling and modifying electronic circuits, working with both analog and digital systems. My role demands attention to detail, patience, and continuous learning to keep up with the latest advancements in electronic technology. Being self-employed has also strengthened my customer service and business management skills, as I handle client interactions, job scheduling, and inventory management independently.

                    <h2><u>Programming Languages</u></h2>
                    <p>
                        As an aspiring software developer, my journey into programming began with a deep personal interest and curiosity about how software and digital systems work. Initially, I started teaching myself through free online resources and YouTube tutorials, where I gained a foundational understanding of programming concepts. This self-learning phase helped me become familiar with basic coding logic, syntax, and the structure of simple web applications. In 2025, I took a major step forward by enrolling in PLP Academy, where I am now formally studying Software Engineering with a focus on Web Development.
                        <br>
                    Since joining the academy, I have made significant progress in mastering several key programming languages and technologies. I have developed a strong grasp of <b>HTML</b>, which I use to structure web content, and <b>CSS</b>, which allows me to design and style beautiful, responsive web interfaces. I am also confident in using <b>JavaScript</b> to add interactivity and dynamic features to websites, and I’m learning to work with <b>DOM manipulation</b>, <b>functions</b>, and basic <b>event handling</b>. My learning also includes <b>Python</b>, where I’m building skills in writing efficient scripts, solving problems, and understanding programming logic more deeply. Additionally, I’ve been introduced to <b>Database Querying</b>, where I’m learning how to interact with data using SQL and manage databases effectively. I’m currently working on building my own portfolio project that showcases all these skills, marking my transition from a beginner to a capable and growing developer.

                    <h2><u>Web Development</u></h2>
                    <p>
                        I genuinely proud and motivated by the progress I’ve made in web development so far. When I first started, everything felt new and a bit overwhelming, especially transitioning from electronics into coding. However, through consistent learning, practice, and guidance from the PLP Academy, I’ve gained a solid understanding of how websites are built and function. I now feel confident working with HTML and CSS to create well-structured, visually appealing web pages, and I’ve been able to bring my ideas to life through layouts, styling, and animations.
                        <br>
                        Learning JavaScript has been a game-changer, as it has allowed me to add interactivity and real functionality to my web projects. It’s exciting to see how much I’ve grown—from writing simple lines of code to now building full web pages and applications that respond to user actions. I still have a lot to learn, but seeing my improvement gives me a strong sense of achievement and fuels my desire to keep going. Every small milestone I reach makes me more confident that I’m on the right path, and I’m excited about what I’ll be able to build in the near future.

                    <h2><u>Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking</u></h2>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, both as an electronics technician and now as a programming student, I’ve developed strong problem-solving and critical thinking skills that have been essential in tackling technical challenges. In electronics, I often deal with devices that have complex faults with no obvious causes. This has trained me to think analytically, break down systems into smaller components, and systematically test and identify issues. I’ve learned to stay calm under pressure, ask the right questions, and approach problems from different angles until I find the most effective and efficient solution. This mindset has naturally carried over into my journey in software development.
                        <br>
                        As I learn programming, I’ve found these skills to be incredibly valuable. Debugging code, for example, requires the same patience and logical thinking as troubleshooting a faulty circuit. When facing errors or bugs, I analyze the problem line by line, review the flow of logic, and use debugging tools or console logs to trace the issue. I’m also learning to think ahead by planning my code structure, considering different user scenarios, and writing solutions that are not just functional but also efficient and maintainable. I enjoy problem-solving because it challenges me to think creatively and continuously improve my approach. Whether it's fixing a hardware issue or building a web application, I take pride in finding smart, practical solutions that work.
