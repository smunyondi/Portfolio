                <p>
                    As a passionate and self-driven tech enthusiast, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a few impactful projects that reflect both my background in electronics and my growing skills in software development. Some of the key projects I’ve worked on include a <b>Smart Home Automation System</b>, which integrates electronics and coding to control home devices remotely; an <b>E-Waste Management System</b>, aimed at promoting responsible electronic waste disposal through a digital platform; and my current <b>Portfolio Project</b>, which serves as my personal online CV showcasing my skills, experience, and journey in web development. These projects have allowed me to apply both practical and theoretical knowledge while sharpening my creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking abilities.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I designed and built a system that allows users to control household appliances remotely using a smartphone or computer. I integrated electronic components such as sensors, relays, and microcontrollers (like Arduino) to enable automation features such as lighting control, temperature monitoring, and motion detection. I wrote the control logic using embedded programming and created a simple web interface for user interaction. This project helped me bridge the gap between electronics and software, and taught me how to build IoT-based solutions.

                    <p>
                        This was a software-focused project aimed at addressing the growing issue of electronic waste. I developed a web-based platform where users can register, log in, and report e-waste for proper collection or recycling. The system included features like location tracking, user notifications, and admin management. I built the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while managing data and user records through backend scripting and database integration. The project enhanced my skills in user interface design, backend development, and database querying.

                        My current portfolio project serves as my personal online CV, showcasing my background, skills, and projects. I’m designing and developing a responsive and well-structured website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with plans to integrate backend support for future updates. The site is it highlights my journey from electronics technician to software developer. This project is helping me apply everything I’ve learned so far, while also giving me a professional platform to present myself to potential clients or employers.
